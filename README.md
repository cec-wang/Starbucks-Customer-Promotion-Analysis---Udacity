# Starbucks-Customer-Promotion-Analysis---Udacity
This projected is created as part of the fulfillment for Udacity Data Science Nanodegree. Here I take data on customer demographic, promotions and customer purchasing history and try to recommend the best promotion for the customer. 

## The problem: ##
I take experimental data collected over a period of one month by Starbucks on their customer's purchasing history, and discover what are the groups in there and what are the offers that really excite people. The purpose of the project is to discover the best offer for customers at Starbucks. 

## Data: ##
To run the program successfully, you will need three sets of data: 

**portfolio.json**
* id (string) - offer id
* offer_type (string) - type of offer ie BOGO, discount, informational
* difficulty (int) - minimum required spend to complete an offer
* reward (int) - reward given for completing an offer
* duration (int) - time for offer to be open, in days
* channels (list of strings)
